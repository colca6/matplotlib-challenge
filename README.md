UCI Bootcamp Mod 5 plotting homework
This was a difficult homework, but easier than the last. 

My weakness seems to be figuring out what to do, but in this case, as was the case last week, there were pretty good examples to follow in the class demos and exercises.  Once I was able to figure out (with the help of the starter file) what to do, I was able to find examples with syntax.  Still a big place of confusion to me is keeping track of when to use a list, vs a dataframe, etc, although I think it's becoming a little clearer as we go on.

I just wish we'd stop and hover for a week or so!

Anyway, a couple times I put links to Stack Overflow in comments, where I found stuff.

I also called BCS Assistant, and Ryan Ellison was amazing! I was trying to loop through the drugs, but I was referencing the wrong dataframe, because the correct one was not working either. Of course, something upstream was off, and he helped me through that, not just by doing it, but really spent 30 minutes or so with me talking through stuff. He was great.
